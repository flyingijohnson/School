- zombie dice
13 dice with brains, footsteps, and shotgun icons on their faces.
Dice icons are colored, each color has a different likelihood of each event 
occuring. Every die has two dsides with footsteps, but dice with green icons 
have more sides with brains, red-icon dice have more shotguns, and yellow-icon 
dice have an even split of brains and shotguns.

Each player's turn:

1. Place all 13 dice in the cup. Player randomly draws three dice from the cup 
and rolls them. Players always roll exactly three dice.

2. They set aside and count up any brains and shotguns. Accumulating three
shotgus automatically ends a player's turn with zero points (regardless of how
many brains they had). If they have between zero and two shotguns, they may 
continue rolling if they want. They may also choose to end their turn and
collect one point per brain.

3. If the player decides to keep rolling, they must reroll all dice with
footsteps. Remember that the player must always roll three dice; they must draw
more dice out of the cup if they have fewer than three dice; they must draw more
dice out of the cup if they have fewer than three footsteps to roll. A playermay 
keep rolling dice until either they get three shotgus--losing everything--or all 
13 dice have been rolled. A player may not reroll only one or two dice, and may 
not stop mid-reroll.

4. When someone reaches 13 brains, the rest of the players finish out the round. 
The person with the most brains wins. If there's a tie, the tied players play
one last tiebreaker round.
