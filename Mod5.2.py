# 5.2:
# On page 299 of the text, do the project "2048".  (Bottom of chapter 12) You should
# submit the .py file as proof of completion of this assignment.
# 2048 is a simple game where you combine tiles by sliding them up, down, left, or
# right with the arrow keys. You can actually get a fairly high score by repeatedly
# sliding in an up, right, down, and left pattern over and over again. Write a program
# that will open the game at https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ and keep sending
# up, right, down, and left keystrokes to automatically play the game.
